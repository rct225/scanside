<h1>Device Function Group</h1>
<p>All I/O functions must be initiated with <a href="../../function/Device/DRV_DEVICEOPEN.htm">DRV_DeviceOpen</a>, 
which opens a device via Device file to return the driver handle of the 
device. With the driver handle, user can use the device to perform I/O 
operations by calling various functions. Call
<a href="../../function/Device/DRV_DEVICECLOSE.htm">DRV_DeviceClose</a> to 
finish the operation and free the resources allocated by <a href="../../function/Device/DRV_DEVICEOPEN.htm">DRV_DeviceOpen</a>.</p>
<p>The calling flow is shown as below:<br>
&nbsp;<img border="0" src="image001.jpg"></p>
<h2><b>Device file </b>(Type: string)</h2>
<p>Device file specifies the device on which you want to perform the I/O 
operations.</p>
<p>For example, a device has association with a device file <i>&quot;/dev/advdaq0&quot;</i> 
using <i>advdevice_bind </i>utility. You can assign the device file &quot;<i>/dev/advdaq0</i>&quot; to the function <a href="../../function/Device/DRV_DEVICEOPEN.htm">DRV_DeviceOpen</a> 
directly. <br></p>
<b> DRV_DeviceOpen and DRV_DeviceClose
Functions </b>
<p><a href="../../function/Device/DRV_DEVICEOPEN.htm">DRV_DeviceOpen</a> 
initializes the device specified by device file. This function must be called 
before any other methods that perform I/O operations.
<a href="../../function/Device/DRV_DEVICECLOSE.htm">DRV_DeviceClose</a> 
is the counterpart function of the <a href="../../function/Device/DRV_DEVICEOPEN.htm">DRV_DeviceOpen</a> function. 
Its purpose is to close the device.</p>
<h2><b>Driver Handle</b> <b>(Type: Long, Size: 4 bytes) </b> </h2>
<p>Driver Handle is returned by <a href="../../function/Device/DRV_DEVICEOPEN.htm">DRV_DeviceOpen</a>. 
It points to the structure that keeps the settings of a device. The subsequent functions 
require the use of Driver Handle, instead of device file, to represent the desired device.
</p>
<h2><b>Error code(Type: Unsigned Long, Size: 
4 bytes) and DRV_GetErrorMessage</b></h2>
<p>Each driver function returns an <a href="../../errorcodes/errorcodes.htm">Error Code</a> 
that indicates whether or not the function was performed successfully. If the 
function has failed to perform, it will return a code that is non-zero. 
The error code may be passed to the <a href="../../function/others/DRV_GetErrorMessage.htm">DRV_GetErrorMessage</a> 
function to retrieve its error message.</p>
