<h1>Fast Analog Input&nbsp; (FAI) Functions</h1>
<p>Except the software transferring, all the other analog sampling methods, 
including DMA, bus-master DMA, interrupt etc., are identified as FAI (Fast 
Analog Input) 
functions. The operation modeling and flow control in all kinds of FAI sampling 
methods are similar.<p>For more detailed information about FAI flow, please refer to the
<a href="../../flow/ai/Interrupttrig.htm">Interrupt transferring</a> and 
<a href="../../flow/ai/dmatrig.htm">DMA transferring</a>:<h2>Initiate a sampling data buffer</h2><p>
In FAI data operation, the size of buffer is not determined by the FIFO size. 
However, before you engage sampling, you must set up your sampling count, i.e. 
the size of&nbsp;sampling data buffer in our example should be the sample count that you want 
multiplies with the size of one sample .
Commonly we need to create a sampling data buffer first and pass the pointer to 
the driver for later acquisition.&nbsp;The buffer is created by the user, commonly according to your sampling count, but used in the kernel mode by 
the driver. In order to have enough space and make sure the data not to be lost, 
the buffer size (sampling count) needs to be set properly.</font></p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

	Please refer 
	to the table below for setting buffer size:

&nbsp;

<div class=tablediv >
<table cellspacing="0" class="Bordered" >
	<tr>
		<td  colSpan="2" rowSpan="2">Condition\Method</td>
		<td colSpan="4" >
		Buffer Size&#65288; Unit: the size of one sample&#65289; 
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Even </td>
		<td>Multiple of the FIFO/2 Size </td>
		<td>Multiple of the count of channels 
		(recommended)</td>
		<td>&gt;4K(recommended)</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td rowspan="2">Cards with and using FIFO</td>
		<td>Interrupt</td>
		<td>&#8730</td>
		<td>&#8730;</td>
		<td>&#8730;</td>
		<td>&nbsp;</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Bus-Master DMA</td>
		<td>&#8730;</td>
		<td>&nbsp;</td>
		<td>&nbsp;</td>
		
		<td>&#8730;</td>
		
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Cards without or not using FIFO</td>
		<td>Interrupt</td>
		<td>&#8730;</td>
		<td></td>
		<td>&nbsp;</td>
		<td></td>
	</tr>
</table>
</div>
<p>For the cards use FIFO, if it is sampled by interrupt, the buffer 
size should be an even number and a multiple of half the FIFO size, while it is 
recommended to be a multiple of the channel count. If it is bus-master DMA, there 
is no limit to the size of buffer, while 4k bytes is recommended.</p>
<h2>Engage the data sampling</h2>
<p>Interrupt mode data sampling will be started by the <a href="DRV_FAIIntStart.htm">
DRV_FAIIntStart</a> function. The 
<a href="DRV_FAIDmaExStart.htm">DRV_FAIDmaExStart</a> function is for 
bus-master DMA. <br>
Different sampling methods need different settings. The 
corresponding structure for each method needs to be created first and uses its 
pointer as a function parameter in order to pass all necessary settings, 
including the previous initiated buffer, to the driver.<br>

<br>
Please note that DAS cards only support the functions the hardware 
supports. For example,&nbsp; PCI1712 
supports bus-master DAM sampling. Trying to call an unsupported function will get 
an error code. Please refer to function support tables and the <i>Hardware 
Manual</i> for more details.</p>
<h2>Data transfer</h2>
<p>Once the data sampling is engaged, users have to know the current sampling 
status and transfer data from sampling buffer to user buffer in time 
for later operation. Two methods are used to get the sampling status. One is to enable the 
required events (by calling 
<a href="../commonhighspeed/DRV_EnableEvent.htm">
		DRV_EnableEvent</a></a>) and wait for the event notification (by calling <a href="../commonhighspeed/DRV_CheckEvent.htm">
		DRV_CheckEvent</a>), then check the status (by calling <a href="DRV_FAICheck.htm">DRV_FAICheck</a>); 
the other is to check the data transferring status repeatedly (by calling <a href="DRV_FAICheck.htm">DRV_FAICheck</a>). 
When the event is signaled or the checked status indicates that either buffer is 
full, call the data 
transfer function (<a href="DRV_FAITransfer.htm">DRV_FAITransfer</a>) to fetch data from sampling data 
buffer to user buffer. </p>
<p>Following is a list of the Events supported in FAI:</p>
</p>

	<div class=tablediv>
	<table  cellspacing="0" class="Bordered">	<tr>
		<td>ADS_EVT_INTERRUPT</td>
		<td>
				Triggered when a certain number of interrupts occur. The 
		number is specified when applications call
				the
		<a href="../commonhighspeed/DRV_EnableEvent.htm">
		DRV_EnableEvent</a>.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>ADS_EVT_BUFCHANGE<br>ADS_EVT_AI_HIBUFREADY<br>ADS_EVT_AI_LOBUFREADY</td>
		<td>
		Generally, in the high speed analog input operation, 
		user's buffer is divided into two equal parts, the low buffer and the high 
		buffer. Data from the device will fill them separately. This event will 
		be signaled when either buffer is full. Applications can call the
		<a href="DRV_FAICheck.htm">DRV_FAICheck</a> to 
		check which buffer is full, and then call
		the
		<a href="DRV_FAITransfer.htm">DRV_FAITransfer</a> 
		to take away the data in this buffer. If the data hasn't been taken away 
		in time, the event <b>ADS_EVT_OVERRUN</b> will be signaled.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>ADS_EVT_TERMINATED <br>ADS_EVT_AI_TERMINATED</td>
		<td>
		Triggered when a high speed analog input operation 
		finishes, or when applications call the
		<a href="DRV_FAITerminate.htm">
		DRV_FAITerminate</a>.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>ADS_EVT_OVERRUN<br>ADS_EVT_AI_OVERRUN</td>
		<td>
		Triggered when the data in the buffer has not been taken 
		away in time after an <b>ADS_EVT_BUFCHANGE</b> occurs. If <b>
		ADS_EVT_OVERRUN</b> occurs, the data would be overwritten by new ones.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>ADS_EVT_TIME_OUT</td>
		<td>
		Triggered when no event has occurred during the wait 
		interval in the <a href="../commonhighspeed/DRV_CheckEvent.htm">
		DRV_CheckEvent</a>.</td>
	</tr>
</table>
</div>
<p>The figure below explains how the sampling buffer works and when the data is transferred<span lang="en-us">:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 9pt"><img border="0" src="Data_Buffer_normal.jpg" width="683" height="245"></span></p><p>The four graphs above show the sampling buffer working on a proper cycle:
<br>
<br>
(1) The sampling data buffer is used as two equal size sections, the 1st half ( 
low half ) and the 2nd half ( high half ). When the sampling starts, the driver 
will 
write data starting from the 1st half.<br>
<br>
(2) When the
		<a href="../commonhighspeed/DRV_EnableEvent.htm">
		DRV_EnableEvent</a> function is called, should the 1st half be full, the driver 
will create a buffer change event 
(ADS_EVT_BUFCHANGEGE, ADS_EVT_AI_HIBUFREADY, ADS_EVT_AI_LOBUFREADY) to notify the user's program. The user's program should transfer the data in time, otherwise the buffer 
will overrun if the 2nd half is full.<br>
<br>
(3) At the same time, data <span lang="en-us">sampling</span> is keeping going on the 2nd half during the data 
transfer.<br>
<br>
(4) When the
		<a href="../commonhighspeed/DRV_EnableEvent.htm">
		DRV_EnableEvent</a> function is called, should the 2nd half be full, a buffer change event 
(ADS_EVT_BUFCHANGEGE, ADS_EVT_AI_HIBUFREADY) will be signaled. The data sampling will be completed for 
non-cyclic mode, while for cyclic mode, data will log back to the 1st half 
again (graph 1). </p>
	<p>
	As described above, if the data has not been transferred in time, the 
	previously acquired data will be overwritten. See the figure below:</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 9pt">
<img border="0" src="Data_Buffer_over_flow.jpg" width="656" height="249"></span><br>
</p>
<p>After the sampling, 
we need to copy the data from the sampling data 
buffer to the transfer buffer</b> 
for analyzing (by calling <a href="DRV_FAITransfer.htm">DRV_FAITransfer</a>, or 
copy by yourself and calling <a href="DRV_ClearFlag.htm">DRV_ClearFlag</a> to 
notify the driver your behave), so that the transfer buffer should also be 
allocated. However, the size of the transfer buffer should be half of the 
sampling buffer.<br>
<br>
